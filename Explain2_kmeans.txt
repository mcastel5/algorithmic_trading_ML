K-Means Clustering
- Def: unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinc subgroups based on feature similarity
- Purpose: group similar assets together to identify patters or segments within the dataset

Centroids
- Def: a central point in each cluster. K-means minimizes the distance between each point and its Centroids
- k-means++: a meathod for initializing centroids before running the K-means algorithm. This increases the chances of finding a proper clustering solution
- Predefined centroids: centroids can otherwise be set manually based on prior knowledge or research

Process description
1. Initialization of first K centroids (can be random, predetermined etc)
2. Assignment of each data point to its closest centroid
3. Centroids redefined as mean of all datapoints assigned to their each cluster
4. Iteration: assignment and update steps repeat until convergence, where centroids no longer change significantly between iterations

The more accurate the initial centroid prediction, the faster convergence is reached
